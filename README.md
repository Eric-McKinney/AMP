Adaptive Music Player for Spotify

I started this project basically knowing nothing except the basics. I also don't know how to use GitHub as of writing this. Basically, it's gonna look weird since I don't know common practices in programming with Python, except a few things I learned along the way.

|File|Description|
| ---------- | ---------- |
|main.py|The main script|
|connection.py|Assigning an intensity from 0 to 5 to user's current activiy|
|speaker.py|Using assigned intensity to create a playlist in user's Spotify account|
|cred.py|Spotify API credentials (obviously didn't include my own credentials)|
|preferences|Contains names of programs with intensities assigned to them|
