I started this project basically knowing nothing except the basics. I also don't know how to use GitHub as of writing this. Basically, it is gonna look ugly.

|File|Description|

|connection.py|Assigning an intensity from 0 to 5 to user's current activiy|
|speaker.py|Using assigned intensity to create a playlist in user's Spotify account|
