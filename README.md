Adaptive Music Player for Spotify

I started this project basically knowing nothing except the basics. I also don't know how to use GitHub as of writing this. Basically, it is gonna look ugly.


main.py is file that is run

connection.py deals with finding out what the most memory intensive process is and assigning it a number from 0 to 5 representing the intensity

speaker.py deals with the Spotify API

cred.py contains the creditials for the Spotify API
