Adaptive Music Player for Spotify

I started this project basically knowing nothing except the basics. I also don't know how to use GitHub as of writing this. Basically, it is gonna look ugly.


main.py is file that is run

|File|Description|
|----------|----------|
|main.py|WIP|
|connection.py|WIP|
|speaker.py|WIP|
|cred.py|WIP|

connection.py deals with finding out what the most memory intensive process is and assigning it a number from 0 to 5 representing the intensity

speaker.py deals with the Spotify API

cred.py contains the credentials for the Spotify API
